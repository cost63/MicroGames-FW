# MicroGames Game Framework

**Project is in its initial development phases**

The purpose of this framework is to develop mainly 2D games with complete control over the process with minimal dependencies. Framework is build on SDL2 2.0.4 and OpenGL 3.3. We also support Lua for scripts with our own binding. Framework also supports use of XML for data storage.

The framework is written purely in C++ (C++14) and is currently compiled only for Windows, other platforms are not supported **yet**. Both MinGW (gcc 5.1.0) and VC++(v14) compilers are used. 

### Dependecies
